## Import scripts

To prepare data for importing into SORMAS with the import scripts one can use the import templates downloaded from the UI, note that the second header must be removed from them.
Execute the script as super user on the SORMAS database, also make sure the user has access to the prepared CSV on the host system.

## Delete scripts
The delete script removed entries for good, it is not 'soft delete', to be executed with caution by sys-admins only.
